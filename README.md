Starter for testing stuff

## Purpose
I created this for testing out different stuff. Needed a base with a proper setup.

## Workflow
When I want to test something, I fork this and learn from scratch. For an example, I may create a fork with a SCSS setup and a good looking design. If not forking, I may be branching.
